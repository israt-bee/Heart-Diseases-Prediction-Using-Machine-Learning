 🫀 Heart Diseases Prediction Using Machine Learning :
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical features. This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters using a Logistic Regression model.

 📊 Dataset:
The project uses the heart_disease_data.csv dataset, which contains various attributes related to heart health.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
1.Python
2.Pandas, NumPy
3.Scikit-learn
4.Jupyter Notebook

🤖 ML Algorithms Applied:
Logistic Regression
 Model Performance
🤖The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately [0.8512396694214877
Training Accuracy] on the training data and [0.819672131147541 Test Accuracy] on the test data.
💡 Future Improvements:
1.Address the ConvergenceWarning during model training by scaling the data or adjusting model parameters.
2.Explore other classification algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forest) to compare their performance.
3.Perform feature engineering to potentially improve model accuracy.
